Breadth First Search: Shortest Reach

Consider an undirected graph where each edge is the same weight. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively.

You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected graph. After you create a representation of the graph, you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Distances are to be reported in node number order, ascending. If a node is unreachable, print  for that node. Each of the edges weighs 6 units of distance.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries. Each of the following  sets of lines has the following format:

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , describing an edge connecting node  to node .
The last line contains a single integer, , denoting the index of the starting node.
